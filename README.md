# Leetcoding-in-racket

Welcome to my **Leetcoding in Racket** repository! This is a personal project where I solve one Leetcode problem every day using Racket, document the approach in an editorial format, and upload both the solution and editorial here on GitHub.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to improve my problem-solving skills and familiarize myself with a variety of Leetcode problems, all while using Racket as my programming language of choice. This repository will serve as a comprehensive collection of my daily problem-solving journey.

Every day, I will:
- Solve a Leetcode problem in Racket.
- Write a detailed editorial explaining the approach, thought process, and solution.
- Upload the solution and editorial to this repository.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


## How to Use
1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the `solutions` folder, where each dayâ€™s folder contains a solution to the problem and the editorial.
2. **Read Editorials**: Each editorial contains an explanation of how the problem was solved, any challenges faced, and time/space complexity analysis where applicable.
3. **Contribute**: Feel free to fork this repo and contribute your own solutions or suggestions for improvements!

## Daily Problem Log
I aim to solve one problem per day, and as I progress, this section will serve as a log of all the problems solved.

| Day  | Problem Name         | Solution Link            |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Day 1| Student attendance record-1            | [Day 1 Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/solutions/6080325/recursive-racket-solution-in-o-n-time) |
| Day 2| Valid Anagram  | [Day 2 Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/solutions/6089238/recursive-racket-solution-in-o-n-log-n-time) |
| Day 3  | Invert Binary Tree | [Day 3 Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/solutions/6095843/recursive-solution-in-o-n-time)|

## Why Racket?
Racket is a great language for functional programming, and Iâ€™ve chosen it for this challenge because of its unique approach to solving problems. Itâ€™s an opportunity to deepen my understanding of functional paradigms while tackling algorithmic challenges.
